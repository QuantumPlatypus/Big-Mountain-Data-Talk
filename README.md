# Big Mountain Data Talk


This is an ipython notebook that does a walkthrough of using pySpark to do some basic data science on the bike share data set from the UCI machine learning archive.

The idea is not to do in depth machine learning, but rather to provide a jump start into pySpark and distributed computing for people already familiar with Python.

This formed the basis of my talk on pySpark at Winter 2015 Big Mountain Data conference.
